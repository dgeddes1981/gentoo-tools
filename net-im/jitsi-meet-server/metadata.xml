		Jitsi Meet is a WebRTC JavaScript application that uses Jitsi
 		Videobridge to provide high quality, scalable video conferencing.

		This package provides a convenient (server-side) control service,
		for both OpenRC and systemd, to allow all necessary subcomponent
		services to be started, stopped and restarted together. Intended
		for use on 'single box' installs only; more complex applications
		should configure the various subcomponents severally.

		Automated TLS (HTTPS) certificate management via Let's Encrypt is
		supported as an option, including automated initial issuance and
		renewal.

		Both OpenRC and systemd are supported, as are both the nginx
		(preferred) and apache webservers.

		_This is the package to emerge_ if you want to install a Jitsi Meet
		server instance on a Gentoo node, as it will pull in all other necessary
		components as dependencies.

		Once built, issue:
			emerge --config jitsi-meet-master-config
		to configure all subcomponents together, after which jitsi-meet-server
		may be started.
